	<h2>About Emma</h2>
		<p>
		Emma loves overcoming obstacles. Emma is goal driven and constantly works to get more wins in her work. 
		In each of her endeavours at work, she seeks to fully complete each of her tasks, while seeking to find new sub-problems to solve. 	
		She keeps her workspace clean between tasks, but as they progress, the clutter reflects the amount of concurrent tasks.
		She is constantly looking for people who can bring new aspects to her teams.

			</li>
			<li>
			Grab a beer with friends at least once a week
			</li>
		</ul>

			<p class="center">Gary has created a website that takes a very un-original design and puts it in a while new light. 
				He has adapted the google look and feel to a personal website in a very clever way. 
				In addition, the embedded social media plug-ins add a great way to spread his site.</p>
			
		<a href="http://www.strajnic.net/" ><h2 class="center">http://www.strajnic.net/</h2></a>
			<p class="center">Vladimir has great animations on his page through the use of css and javascript.
				His biography also has some nice scroll buttons on the right side.
				His work is also highlighted well using images but I would have liked to have a bit more activity in the portfolio pages.

		<a href="http://www.hannahsilverton.com/" ><h2 class="center">http://www.hannahsilverton.com/</h2></a>
			<p class="center">Hannah's web page has some nice elements. The opening image immediately throws you into the theme of her website.
				The page also displays all of the different topics in a fantastic way, loading in graphics as you approach them, 
				and a header bar that gracefully slides you to the section you want to be in.</p>
			
		<a href="http://www.pascalvangemert.nl/" ><h2 class="center">http://www.pascalvangemert.nl/</h2></a>
			<p class="center">Pascal van Gemert has a nice scrolling interface similar to Hannah's website, with a nice categories interface on the left side.
				Pascal also displays resume like information in a very pleasing way, using a mix of traditional styles and rating systems. </p>
			
		<a href="http://www.sarahlichang.com/" ><h2 class="center">http://www.sarahlichang.com/</h2></a>
			<p class="center">Sarah stays with a much more plain design, but this does not keep her from implementing some extremely interesting tools.
				Her map and photography pages are fun ways to see a bit more about her,
				and the way the the top bar scrolls and the text slides behind it are fluid means to present her website. </p>
